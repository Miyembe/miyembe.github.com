Hi everyone! (who is possibly struggling with computer science things like me)

Today I will explain the concept of libraries (static, dynamic) in c++. 

The reason I am writing this is because I don't know about the concept of libraries and purpose of each type of library files.

So far, what I have known is that library is a compiled code that can be used as a module in other files so that they can be called without needs of re-compilation every time.

However, I don't know what is exactly different between static and dynamic library.

I have struggled with library loading error in a swarm robotic simulator called ARGoS3. I am making fury eyes to the error after trying to figure out more than few hours. 

After I asked this problem to author of the simulator, he said it might be the linking problem among libraries of different files that relate each other. 

By the time, I am trying linking libraries. However, I am not familiar with the concept of "linking" the libraries. 

Here, I will explain what is the library file and the features of library including that linking thing as easy as possible.
